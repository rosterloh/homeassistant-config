  ## First Photo
  - local/images/washingmachine.jpg # Path to your washingmachine image (if you don't have one you can use the default ones that are included)
  - sensor.washing_machine_status # Washing Machine Status Sensor (this is a custom sensor created as a template sensor, you will need a power-plug that can read energy usage for this to work well)
  - switch.washing_machine # Washing Machine Switch Entity
  - sensor.washing_machine_power # Washing Machine Power Sensor (this is a sensor that comes with most energy usage reading power-plugs, if you have AliExpress stuff like a Sonoff Pow R2, I highly recommend you to use ESPHome!)
