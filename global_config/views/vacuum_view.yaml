# Popup Cards (If you have set up a custom template in the top buttons of this view, filling in anything below this is probably useless)

# Vacuum Sensors (if you have a Roborock S5 you can simply leave this at the defaults! You will however need all related automations and template sensors!)

# Maps
## Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card
vacuum_map:
#  map_type: camera # Choose either between `camera` or `map` (without the quotes). This will determine if the above setting is a camera entity or an image location.
#  map_image: camera.rockrobo_map # Can be either a camera entity or an image. Example when used with an image: `/local/images/xiaomi-map.png`. (You will need to get the map yourself some way https://community.home-assistant.io/t/xiaomi-vacuum-interactive-map-card/123901) 

# IMPORTANT!
### Please edit the calibration points in lovelace/views/includes/vacuum_calibration.yaml
