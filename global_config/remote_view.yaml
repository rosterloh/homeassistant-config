# Remote Control View (the current template only works with a remote.entity. This was specifically created for the Apple TV. I will publish other templates in the future)
remote:
  # Living Room
  ## First Row (On/Off Switches)
  - switch.samsung_tv # Livingroom TV entity (switches are preferred as they work better with button-card! See my template switches for examples on how to do this!)
  - switch.receiver # Livingroom Audio Receiver entity (switches are preferred once again)
  ## Media Player and Remote
  - media_player.samsung_tv_ue65ku6000 # Livingroom Media Player Entity that controls the volume (this can be a receiver entity as well, as long as it is within the media_player domain)
  - media_player.woonkamer_apple_tv # Livingroom Media Player Entity to show in the mini-media-player card (in my case it is an Apple TV)
  - remote.woonkamer_apple_tv # Livingroom Remote Entity for controlling the actual remote (this can be a TV for example or in my case an Apple TV)
  # Bedroom
  ## First Row (On/Off Switches)
  - switch.tv_slaapkamer # Bedroom TV entity (switches are preferred as they work better with button-card! See my template switches for examples on how to do this!)

  ## Media PLayer and Remote
  - media_player.samsung_tv_ue46es5500 # Bedroom Media Player Entity that controls the volume (this can be a receiver entity as well, as long as it is within the media_player domain)
